<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p> I am currently working in a Law Firm. I am an Office Administrator. </p>

<h3> PORTFOLIO</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fowler Law Group</li>

<p> I work as an Office Administrator at Fowler Law Group. I wear many hats at the office, which means I am tasked to do various assignments whether that is restocking the keurig coffee pods or proofreading court documents written by the attorneys.</p>

<li>Zara</li>

<p>I worked as a cashier. The clothes were glamorous. The job was not. I handled lots of money and lots of entitled people.</p>

<li>California Coalition Against Sexual Assault</li>

<p>I worked as a Campus Program Assistant. I wrote and researched content on the prevalency of sexual assault on college campuses.</p>

<li>Other Things I have Done</li>

<p> I graduated from UCLA with a BA in English. I minored in drinking wagon loads of coffee. </p>
